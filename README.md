#Credit card fraud detection 

#Dataset link : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud

# Objective 

-- Explored and visualized the transaction dataset 

-- Observed data imbalance between fraudlent and legitimate transactions

-- Trained Machine Learning models like Logistic Regression and Random Forest , Decision Tree 

-- Evaluated  using confusion matrix , precision and recall

# Tools and Libraries

-- pandas ,Matplotlib , Seaborn 

-- Scikit-learn 

## Outcome
 Trained multiple models and found that Random Forest classifier performed the best for the imbalanced dataset . It achieved a high F!-score of 0.85 for fraud detection with strong precision and recall , making it the most reliable model for minimizing false postives and flase negative in fraud detection.
